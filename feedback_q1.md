In the class Tester, there are following issues in the functions: 

1. def iterative_mult(w) :
* Usually it's better not to hardcode values, so it's better to use self.M.shape instead of 100

2. def matrix_mult(w) :
* perfect

3. def comparison(w) :
* perfect 

4. Plotting
* Since we have given x-values that are powers of ten, it is better to use logarithmic scale for plotting
* Look up how legend is used in plotting. It isn't visible as of now
* Only one line seems to be visible, there need to be two
* You seem to have missed the part of the assignment where you need to fill in the reasons for the observed times.
